      "**Partial Differential Equations** (PDEs) describe the evolution of dynamical systems involving both time and space. Examples in physics include sound, heat, electromagnetism, fluid flow, elasticity, among others. Examples in biology include tumor growth, population dynamics, and epidemic propagations.\n",
      "\n",
      "PDEs are hard to solve analytically. Therefore, PDEs are often studied via numerical simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this featured recipe, we will illustrate how to simulate a reaction-diffusion system described by a PDE called the **Fitzhugh\u2013Nagumo equation**. A reaction-diffusion system models the evolution of one or several variables subject to two processes: reaction (transformation of the variables into each other) and diffusion (spreading across a spatial region). Some chemical reactions may be described by this type of model, but there are other applications in physics, biology, ecology, and other disciplines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, we simulate a system that has been proposed by Alan Turing as a model of animal coat pattern formation. Two chemical substances influencing skin pigmentation interact according to a reaction-diffusion model. This system is responsible for the formation of patterns that are reminiscent of the pelage of zebras, jaguars, and giraffes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will simulate this system with the finite difference method. This method consists of discretizing time and space, and replacing the derivatives by their discrete equivalents."
